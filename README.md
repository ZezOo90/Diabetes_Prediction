# Diabetes classifier using svm model
This is my simple prediction model in machine learning! 🎉
The model is designed to predict whether a person has diabetes based on certain features, using the PIMA dataset from Kaggle.I have used Support Vector Machines (SVM) as our algorithm, known for its robust performance in classification tasks. 💪
Here's what makes the model unique:
1. **Easy to understand**: The model is built with simplicity in mind, making it easy to comprehend and interpret results.
2. **Accurate predictions**: I have trained our SVM model on a diverse set of features from the PIMA dataset, resulting in high accuracy predictions. 🔮
3. **Fast execution**: The model is optimized for speed, ensuring quick predictions without sacrificing accuracy. Get your results in no time! ⏱️
4. **Positive approach**: The model focuses on identifying potential health risks and offering solutions rather than perpetuating negative stereotypes or stigmas. 💖
